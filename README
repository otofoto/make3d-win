------------------------

See:
http://make3d.stanford.edu/publications
and:
http://make3d.stanford.edu/publications/code

The parameters in this repository go with the code verion 0.1
of the paper:
Learning 3-D Scene Structure from a Single Still Image, Ashutosh Saxena, Min Sun, Andrew Y. Ng, In ICCV workshop on 3D Representation for Recognition (3dRR-07), 2007.


Again, note that the parameter version may differ from ones
used on the website, or used in ICCV paper; but is the same
version as the code provided.
